# AI_Final-Project_Employee-Attrition-Survival_Group9
This project builds a Python pipeline for employee attrition prediction using survival analysis. We implement KM curves, a Cox PH model, and a Random Survival Forest to capture non-linear effects. An XGBoost classifier is used alongside SHAP for interpretability, outputting individual attrition probabilities to support data-driven HR decisions.
